    BLENDER
    Blender (best for import/export round trip) -- Good for re-importing glTFs exported from Blender, and re-exporting glTFs to glTFs after Blender editing. Bone tips are placed on their local +Y axis (in glTF space).

    TEMPERANCE
    Temperance (average) -- Decent all-around strategy. A bone with one child has its tip placed on the local axis closest to its child.

    FORTUNE
    Fortune (may look better, less accurate) -- Might look better than Temperance, but also might have errors. A bone with one child has its tip placed at its childs root. Non-uniform scalings may get messed up though, so beware.
