    Note that this only handled the first 3 numbers,

    however this is not a priority to support since scripts should only be including stable releases,
    so comparing the first 3 numbers is sufficient. The trailing string is just a tie breaker in the
    unlikely event it differs.If supporting the full spec, comparing: "1.1.dev6" with "1.1.6rc6" for e.g.
    we could support this doesnt seem especially important as extensions should use major releases.
